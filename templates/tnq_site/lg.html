        <dt>When do Senior Sittings Generally Happen</dt>
        <dd>We schedule sittings in the spring semester for rising seniors and in the fall semester for current seniors. Please check the portrait studio’s website for available appointment dates and times.</dd>
        <dt>What should I wear?</dt>
        <dd>The portrait shows what you’re wearing down to the bottom of your ribcage. Most people dress as if they are going to a job interview or a nice restaurant. With that said, there really is no dress code (except, of course, wearing clothes). You may also bring in props if you wish. To make sure you are looking just perfect, we provide a full length mirror in our office and there are restrooms nearby.</dd>
